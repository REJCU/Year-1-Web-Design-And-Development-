        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <h3>Here is a collection of knowledge I have gathered over the years &dArr; &nbsp;</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li>Realise that it's up to you. You are responsible for making it work.</li>
            <li>Attend one lecture and get the notes from the other (start with the web notes, but that's not
                enough)</li>
            <li>Find a friend in the one you miss and get them to tell you what else was covered in class that's
                not on the web</li>
            <li>Which one do you miss? - Some ideas to help you with that decision are:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>If you miss one out of two lectures for a subject, that's 50%. If you miss one out of 3
                        that's 33%.</li>
                        <li>Which one are you most on top of? </li>
                        <li>Which subject has the most complete lecture notes?</li>
                </ol>
            <li>Don't ask your lecturer - "did I miss anything in the lecture?" If you didn't miss anything, there'd
                be no point to lectures</li>
        </ul>
