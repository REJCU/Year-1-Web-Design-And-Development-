  <h2>Goal</h2>
  <p> The main goal of the website is the expansion of 100SMILES Dental Care online presence and reach. 
    Introducing relevant information about their business, staff and promoting healthy dental habits with their business

    articles promoting the knowledge of the business. Promotion of the Annual Dental Check up is included to develop a "life-long"
    journey</p>
  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
  <p> Ways to evaluate a succesful outcome of the website could be through how the dental visit came to fruition. Was it through brick-and-mortar 
    or email (20% discount). Did the customer ask basic questions that were answered on the website or was there query based on 
    that provided information. Does the business experience a greater uptick of customers folowing after the websites deployment. </p>
  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
  <p> The target audience would be young families. Great focus has been put towards on pushing the importance of regular checkups with their promotion of 
      the annual Dental-checkup as an investment towards health and linking multiple articles supporting their claim.  
        </p>
    <p>To cater towards young families, various styling elements will be in use. Bright contrasting colours to appeal towards children. 
        Images to break up long text and provide a visual focal point. Any important or relevant information is highlighted with bright colours to get readers attention</p>
