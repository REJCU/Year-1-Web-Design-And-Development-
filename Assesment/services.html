<h2>Starting Paragraph</h2>

    <ul>
        <ol>Early Detection of Health Issues: Annual Dental Check-ups provide dentists with the opportunity
            to detect potential health issues early on. Just as regular doctor visits are vital for humans,
            routine check-ups for dental health allow dentists to identify and address emerging health
            concerns before they escalate. Early detection often leads to more effective treatments and a
            higher chance of successful outcomes</ol>
        <ol>Preventive Care: Regular cleanings and check-ups are a fundamental component of the Annual
            Dental Check-up. These preventive measures protect you from serious, and sometimes life-
            threatening, dental diseases. Additionally, preventive measures such as X-rays and dental check-
            ups contribute significantly to your overall well-being.</ol>
